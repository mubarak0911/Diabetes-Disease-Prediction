# Diabetes-Disease-Prediction

**INTRODUCTION:-**

Diabetes is a disease that affects how the body controls blood sugar levels. If not managed properly, it can lead to serious health problems. Early prediction of diabetes can help people get the right treatment and stay healthy.

Machine Learning can help doctors and patients by predicting the chances of having diabetes. It works by learning from past data, such as a person's age, weight, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.

In this process, we collect a dataset of peopleâ€”some who have diabetes and some who don't. Each person's information is used to train the computer. The machine learning model then finds patterns in the data that are linked to diabetes.

Once trained, the model can take new information from a person and predict whether they are likely to have diabetes. This helps in early detection and can guide medical advice and treatment.
